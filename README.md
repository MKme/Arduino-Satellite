# Arduino-Satellite
Code and files for the Arduino DIY Satellite poroject

As an ongoing project on my YouYube channel I decided to make a basic Arduino Satellite model and share he process, design and code.

You can find the video series here:

The .stl files work fairly wlll to make a basic 3D printed satellite model.  I forget where I initally got them but ended up having to modify them anyhow.

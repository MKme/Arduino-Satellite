# Arduino-Satellite
Code and files for the Arduino DIY Satellite poroject

As an ongoing project on my YouYube channel I decided to make a basic Arduino Satellite model and share he process, design and code.

You can find the video series here:

The .stl files work fairly wlll to make a basic 3D printed satellite model.  I forget where I initally got them but ended up having to modify them anyhow.


Update Oct 2015
-V7 now performs voice only telemetry downlink
-Future versions will re-introduce the RTTY or Morse downlinks but for now the satellite can speak english :)
-All versions added to GIT so others may benefit

Update Feb 2020
This project is not forgotten! 
New files added to be tested- see atribution from Thingiverse files found here:

V1 Set up basic text tranmission
-Tuned speaker freq and speed

V2 Added watchdog function

V3- Added concept to hear the sound of space!  
Take sensor input such as radiation or light level and map to tone output
Currently Mapping Analog pin 0

V4 Toggle TX mode (CW vs Tone) with millis
Interval is used for length of time to send tone
Satellite now transmits full CW downlink then tone for duration of "Interval"

V5- Code cleanup.  Broke out into separate voids

V6- Commented out watchdog functions as NANO was getting stuck in endless watchdog loop
This is a confirmed bootloader problem here: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=150419.0

V7- Voice Downlink Development
New version- no more morse instead using voice downlink
Can re-use code up to V6 later in order to re activate/use the morse function


********************************************
Notes for DEV:
Add code for external LED to indicate operational state
External LEDs could also flash an error code if system probelm
